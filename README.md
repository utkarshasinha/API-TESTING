# E-commerce API Testing Project

This project involves **API testing for an e-commerce platform** using **Postman**. The goal of the project is to validate the **GET** request to retrieve a list of products from the platform's catalog.
This project highlights my experience in testing APIs, inspired by a seminar on software testing. It shows my ability to create test cases, debug issues, and ensure smooth functionality for web projects.

## API Endpoints Tested

- **GET /products** - Retrieve a list of products available for sale on the e-commerce platform. This validates the correct functioning of the product listing.

## Technologies Used

- **Postman**: Used for making API requests, performing validations, and testing the functionality of endpoints.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and managing project code.
- **JavaScript**: Writing tests and dynamic assertions within Postman.

## Project Status

As of now, the testing focuses solely on the **GET /products** endpoint, ensuring that it returns the correct list of products in the expected JSON format and verifying response time.
