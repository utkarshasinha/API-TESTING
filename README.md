# E-Commerce API Testing

## Step 1: Set up the Postman workspace and collection

### Workspace Creation:
- Create a new workspace in Postman named "API Testing - E-Commerce" to organize all project-related activities.

### Collection Setup:
- Create a collection within the workspace called "E-Commerce API Test Suite" where all the API requests and their respective tests will be stored.

This will be the foundation for testing various API endpoints (like products, cart, and checkout) for an e-commerce platform.
